:Description:
   * Render Images with srcset and size
   * multiple srcsets like sourcecollection include original size and retina Version
   * equal aspect ratio for all images in one content element (like tkcropthumbs)
   * replace clickenlarge viewhelper for lightbox with uri.image viewhelper (better grouping and crop is possible)
   * optional PageTS to remove unwanted settings (width, height, border, etc.)
   * add plyr.io for better handling and styling of video and audio
